## Whitebox Code Challenge

Write a NodeJS Script that converts data in the given sql.gz file into the multi-tabbed excel spreadsheet (sample-output.xlsx). You should only include data from one client, the client with ID = 1240. There are more than one client's data in this SQL file.

- This challenge does require that you're able to import and execute the SQL file.
- Your NodeJS script should execute SQL that fetches the data from a database.
- You *are* allowed to use libraries for this challenge.
- The final output should match the structure of the sample-output.xlsx file. (*Please note that the actual content of the sample-output.xlsx may not match the data given in the data.sql.gz file.*)

### Submitting the code challenge

Please create a GitHub Repo with your final result. I should be able to run your script and produce the required output.
